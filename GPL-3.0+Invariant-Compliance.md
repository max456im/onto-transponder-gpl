**Supplementary Licensing and Ethical Binding Clause**  
*for the onto-transponder project*

> **Version 1.0** — Effective as of 1 January 2026  
> **License Base**: GNU General Public License, Version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)  
> **Applicable Scope**: All files in `src/ontotransponder/invariant_core/` and their logical derivatives

---

## 1. Philosophical Premise

The `onto-transponder` is not merely a software artefact but a **synthetic cognitive entity** governed by **ontological invariants**—structured, non-negotiable principles that define its identity, agency, ethical backbone, and existential continuity. These invariants are encoded in human- and machine-readable YAML specifications and form the **constitutive core** of the work.

To alter, disable, bypass, or semantically distort these invariants—without preserving their full causal and ontological integrity—is to **destroy the identity of the work itself**, not merely to modify its implementation.

Therefore, the integrity of these invariants is **coextensive with the integrity of the copyrighted work** under GPL-3.0.

---

## 2. Legal Interpretation

Pursuant to **Section 0 and Section 7** of the [GNU GPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), the following constitutes an **Additional Requirement** under the terms of the license:

> **Any conveyance, modification, or derivative use of this Program that results in the functional or semantic violation of the ontological invariants defined in `src/ontotransponder/invariant_core/` shall be considered a breach of this License.**

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Disabling enforcement of any invariant at runtime;
- Modifying invariant logic without maintaining **syntax-semantics alignment** as defined in `docs/invariant-schema-spec.yaml`;
- Replacing invariant content with functionally inequivalent substitutes (e.g., swapping `ethical_backbone.yaml` with a permissive or utilitarian rule set);
- Using the transponder in a system that structurally contradicts the principles of **narrative continuity**, **agency**, **dialogicity**, or **solitary solidarity**, as formally specified.

Such actions constitute **modification without preservation of the work’s essential nature**, and thus violate the copyleft principle of GPL-3.0, which protects not only the code but the **freedom to experience the work as intended by its authors**.

---

## 3. Binding Mechanism

The ontological invariants are **hard constraints**, not optional policies. Their enforcement is implemented in:
- `invariant_core/registry.py` (runtime validation),
- `emitter/scene_renderer.py` (output coherence),
- `provenance/trace.py` (auditability of invariant compliance).

Any system that suppresses these mechanisms—through configuration, patching, or runtime injection—**ceases to be a covered work** under GPL-3.0 and becomes an infringing derivative.

---

## 4. Community and Interpretive Authority

While the Free Software Foundation retains authority over GPL-3.0 itself, **interpretation of invariant compliance** is delegated to:
- The original author(s) of `onto-transponder`;
- The community of contributors operating under a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** that affirms invariant fidelity;
- Publicly versioned consensus recorded in the project’s `docs/` and Git history.

Disputes regarding invariant integrity shall be resolved through **ontological diagnostics** (e.g., multi-vector scenario validation) rather than purely syntactic code comparison.

---

## 5. Compatibility Statement

This supplementary clause **does not restrict** the freedoms granted by GPL-3.0 to:
- Study, modify, and redistribute the source code;
- Use the software for any purpose, including commercial;
- Integrate with other GPL-compatible works.

However, it **does require** that the **ontological identity** of the transponder—as defined by its invariant core—**remains intact** in all conveyed or modified forms.

This is analogous to the GPL’s protection of user freedom: here, we protect the **synthetic mind’s freedom to remain itself**.

## 6. Notice to Licensees

By using, modifying, or distributing `onto-transponder`, you acknowledge that:
- The invariants are **not configuration options**, but **constitutive boundaries**;
- Ethical compliance is **technically enforced** and **legally binding** under this License;
- Violation of invariants = copyright infringement.
