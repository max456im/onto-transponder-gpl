# Temperament → Cognitive Architecture Binding
# Based on activity-derived classical temperaments (Chinese calendar year inferred or declared)
# Aligns with onto144 profile schema
#
# Rational basis: 
# - Melancholic: reflective, causal-restorative → onto-richness (NoemaFast → NoemaSlow)
# - Sanguine/Choleric: reactive, adaptive → behav-mod (NoemaSlow → NoemaFast)
# - Phlegmatic: not yet implemented (reserved for future onto144 expansion)
